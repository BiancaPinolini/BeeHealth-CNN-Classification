# BeeHealth-CNN-Classification
This repository focuses on building Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for two key tasks related to honey bee analysis: subspecies classification and health detection. The project utilizes "[The BeeImage Dataset: Annotated Honey Bee Images]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jenny18/honey-bee-annotated-images/code?datasetId=47062&sortBy=voteCount))" from Kaggle.

## Key Features:
* Bee Subspecies Classification: A CNN model designed to classify honey bee subspecies based on annotated images.
* Bee Health Detection: Another CNN model for classifying the health status of honey bees.
* Conv2D Visualization: An analysis of CNN layers by visualizing kernels in the Conv2D layers to understand how the model processes images through convolution.
* Segmentation: Experimenting with image segmentation techniques, such as highlighting bee wings.
